Though you may be in love with decorating your hands with Mehendi, you are probably unaware of the many benefits of Mehendi oil\nMehndi, also known as henna, is made from the leaves of the mehndi shrub that is indigenous to South Asia. The shrub also grows in Australasia and Africa. It is a thorny shrub with tiny leaves and thrives in subtropical climes. When the dried leaves are mixed with essential oils or water, the paste imparts a burgundy red color. The reason that mehndi is very popular is that it is used very commonly at weddings in South Asia. The paste made from dried leaves and oil is used to decorate the bride’s body. In some cultures, even the groom’s hands are decorated with mehndi paste, as it is considered auspicious.\nIf you want to make your drab looking mehndi paste more vibrant and rich, you definitely need mehndi oil.",

So, like other girls, I had the dream of getting married to Mr. Perfect. The extravagant traditions, a host of relatives, grand gastronomic spreads — the list goes on! Mine was one of those big fat Indian weddings that included all of these! And with traditions comes the ritual of decorating the hands with mehendi. Ah! The joys of being a bride! I had beautiful designs of mehendi intricately applied all over my palms and forearms, till a little over my elbows, and my feet were adorned with henna up to the ankles.\n\nThe eight-hour ordeal of getting it done seemed worth it! It looked extremely pretty, and I felt like a princess because of this (and the other pampering rituals). Everything seemed great until after I was married, and my new husband and I were venturing out for our first holiday together – our honeymoon. Suddenly it struck me: how would I dress in all of that hand-picked beachwear with Mehendi adorning my limbs? And mind you! The color was fantastic when it was done, but it had begun to fade and blotch six days into the wedding, and it was not the prettiest sight! I knew something had to be done, and my mehendi problem had to be tackled, so I took it to my best friend, Google.\nThese are some really amazing methods I found and tried. And they worked! Now, when I look back at the photographs and look for the almost negligent color of henna, I can’t help but smile. My experience moved me to put together this list for all the brides with mehendi concerns. I hope these tricks help you as much as they helped me. Read on…",

Next, moisturize your face with a cream or a lotion by pressing it into your skin. It’s best to go with an oil-free moisturizer.\n\n2. Spritz On Rose Water Or A Finishing Mist\nRose water can help reveal that natural glow and keeps your skin looking fresh and supple all day long. Spray it all over your face and neck and allow it to dry naturally before you go in with your actual makeup. You can also use a setting spray BEFORE you start your makeup as this helps create a thin layer on your skin and prevents oils from seeping through your makeup.\nTry the Boscia White Charcoal Mattifying Makeup Setting Spray – its ingredients are great for your skin, and it offers serious anti-aging benefits as well.\n\n3. Primer Is Mandatory\nTo get that sebum under control, a primer is an absolute must. It not only helps control oil production and makes your skin look smoother,",

Mineral foundations also work well on oily skin, because the dry particles tend to absorb moisture and also prevent shine.\n\nYou can try: Hourglass Immaculate Liquid Powder Foundation or Estee Lauder’s Double Wear Stay-In-Place Makeup for lasting and shine-free wear.\n\nDry Skin\n\nIf you’re someone with dry skin, choose a hydrating powder foundation, a liquid or a stick one.

Take the desired cream used for hair straightening. Wash your hair before applying the cream. Scrunch your hair in a clean towel and remove all the water from the hair. Your hair should be damp and prepared for the cream. Brush your hair lightly to remove all the knots and tangles and make hair free.\nTake a small amount of cream in your hand and spread it on your palm. Always start with small amounts as you can always build up the product. Start from the head and spread the product to your tips such that the cream is more concentrated on the ends and sparingly on the scalp area. Run your fingers through your hair to spread the product evenly. Apply once again if needed.\nBrush your hair using a shampoo brush. This will spread the product more evenly into your hair.\nSection your hair into 3-4 sections and secure them with pins. You can do center parting and then convert each half into two more sections and so on.\nStart with the lowest part of the section. Place a round brush under the bottom of the hair and start blow drying. As you blow dry roll the brush towards the tips of the hair. Since the cream is heat activated it will set as heat falls on it. This will remove all the frizz and waves from the hair and make them get the shape you desire.\nContinue brushing and blow drying until your hair is completely dry. Do the same for the rest of the sections.\nFinally, you will have salon straight hair. Isn’t it easy?",
